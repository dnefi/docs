title: "Responses Generated by Gateway"
description: "Understand the meaning of the responses produced by the API gateway."
---

For some API requests, the response body is created by the gateway. This is usually the case in error situations or changing the response generated by the actual API server.

A header is sent through which you can check whether a request was generated by the gateway. If the response headers contain the following header, this indicates that the request was created by the gateway:

```
X-Jojapi-Gateway-Response: true
```

Let’s examine the responses generated by the gateway.

## **Error Messages**

Error messages contain a message. An example response is like this:

```
{"message":"Invalid Server"}
```

Below is a list of error messages:
