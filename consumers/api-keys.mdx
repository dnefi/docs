title: "Using JoJ API Keys"
---

JoJ API Keys provide secure access to APIs listed on the JoJ API Marketplace, allowing you to integrate these APIs into your software and applications. You can [manage your API keys](https://jojapi.com/api-keys) — including creating new keys, deleting existing ones, or assigning custom names for easier organization.

JoJ API supports multiple authentication methods using your API keys. Below are the available options, along with brief explanations and usage examples:

### **1. X-JoJAPI-Key Header**

Send your API key via the custom `X-JoJAPI-Key` HTTP header.

**Example:**

```
X-JoJAPI-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

### **2. Authorization Header**

Pass your API key directly through the `Authorization` header without any prefix.

**Example:**

```
Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY
```

### **3. Bearer Token**

Use the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` scheme followed by your API key.

**Example:**

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### **4. Basic Token**

Send your API key using HTTP Basic Authentication. The `Authorization` header should contain the word `Basic`, followed by a base64-encoded string of `apikey:apikey`.

**Example:**

```
Authorization: Basic BASE64_ENCODED_APIKEY
```

> **Note:**\
> To encode:\
> `echo -n "YOUR_API_KEY:YOUR_API_KEY" | base64`

## **📌 Notes:**

- Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.
