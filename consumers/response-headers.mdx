Some information headers are sent by the gateway to API users. You can find details about these topics in this article.

- **X-Jojapi-Gateway-Response**: This header only takes the value “true”. The presence of this header in the request indicates that the response body was created by the gateway. Read [this](/gateway/gateway-generated-responses) article to see details about the bodies created by the gateway.
- **X-Jojapi-Credits-Remaining**: Specifies the number of instant credits remaining for the API plan you are using after the current request has been processed. This header does not apply to pay as you go plans.
- **X-Jojapi-Credits-Used**: Specifies the number of credits used in the current request.
- **X-Jojapi-Credits-Total-Used**: Specifies the total number of instant credits used for the API plan you are using after the current request has been processed (within the current period). This header applies only to pay as you go plans.
- **X-Jojapi-Request-Latency**: Specifies the completion time for the current request on the gateway. The duration of the request measured by the consumer may be longer.
- **X-Jojapi-User-Balance**: Specifies the remaining user balance after the current request has been processed. This header applies only to pay as you go plans.
