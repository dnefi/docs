You can earn income by offering your APIs through the marketplace or by sharing the API link with your customers.

## **Payouts**

The money earned by API providers through our platform is paid out by JoJ API on the 15th of each month. Payouts are based on earnings from the previous month. JoJ API deducts a 10% commission from the gross earnings. The remaining amount is then sent to the API provider. To process a payout, the minimum amount that must be sent to the API provider is \$30. Earnings below this threshold will not be paid out and will be carried over to the following month.

## **Payout Options**

We can send payments to your bank account, PayPal account or crypto wallet. Contact us for more details.
