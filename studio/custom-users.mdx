In the JoJ API you can control whether users can subscribe to your plans. Learn how to allow or block a user on a plan.

## **Creating a user-specific API plan**

In JoJ API, you can offer special plans to your special customers. First, create a plan. Then choose to edit the plan. Set the plan visibility to “private”. In the Custom Users section, type and add the username of the user you want to allow to the plan. And that’s it.

The user you grant permission to will be able to see the private plan on the API pricing page, even if the plan is hidden for everyone.

## **Blocking a user**

If you want to block a user from subscribing to a plan, simply add the user in the Custom users section and press the block button.

> Note that this only prevents the user from subscribing to the plan. If the user is already subscribed to the plan, this will not prevent the user from using the plan (and therefore from sending API requests). There is not yet a direct way to block the user’s API requests.
